# HELIB Demo

Basic demonstration of homomorphic operations on encrypted data using HELIB

If you want to use this as started for writing HELIB you either clone this folder and overwrite the `ckks_demo.cpp` file
and use the `build.sh` script in the build dir or
- add executeable definitions to `CMakeList.txt`
- add cpp file to root dir
- alter the path to your `HELIB` install in `build.sh`

in either case use `./build.sh` and `make` to compile your code
